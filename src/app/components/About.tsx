              My first contact with programming was creating apps with <a href="https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/QBasic" target="blank">Qbasic</a> on my father&apos;s Pentium 486. Growing up like any other teenager, I dived into sports and computers, so I started writing and designing <a href="http://www.mirc.com" target='blank'>mIRC scripts</a> with sports theme.

              After that, I was asked to add some PHP scripts to my friend&apos;s website, which I managed to did by myself, in early 2000&apos;s. Then, I remember using <a href="https://www.joomla.org/" target="blank">Joomla</a>, <a href="https://simplemachines.org/" target="blank">SMF</a> and <a href="https://wordpress.org/" target="blank">Wordpress</a>, which was useful tools that I would just develop/tweak themes and plugins for online communities, becoming not only the developer, but also the admin...

              That&apos;s all I remember before a drunk driver hit my car. After several hours in the hospital, couple surgeries and a few stiches, I lost a lot of memories, including how to code. That triggered me to become an attorney.

              A few years later, I realize that programming was something I really wanted to do. So I decided to join <a href="https://www.betrybe.com/" target="blank">Trybe bootcamp</a> and focus my studies on learning and understanding Javascript and Typescript, getting passionated by coding in every way and day.
